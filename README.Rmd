_{{ packagename }}_ is an R package to estimate the *Force-of-Infection (FoI)* of a given pathogen from age-disaggregated population-based cross-sectional serosurveys, using a Bayesian framework. The package provides a set of features for assessing model fitting, convergence and visualisation. 

_{{ packagename }}_ relies on the [`rstan`](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) package, which provides an R interface for the Stan programming language for statistical Bayesian modelling. Particularly, _{{ packagename }}_ relies on the use of a *Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)* algorithm implemented by *Stan for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)* sampling. The implemented methods are outlined in [@cucunub치2017] and [@carrera2020] (see [FoI Models](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/serofoi/articles/foi_models.html) for further details). A compelling mathematical treatment of the implemented serocatalytic models can be found in [@kamau2025].

_{{ packagename }}_ is part of the [Epiverse Initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

## Installation

You can install _{{ packagename }}_ from CRAN using:

```{r install_from_cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("serofoi")
```

You can install the **development version** of _{{ packagename }}_ from [GitHub](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/serofoi) running:

```{r install_with_pak, eval = FALSE}
if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/serofoi")
```
or:
```{r install_with_remotes, eval = FALSE}
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("epiverse-trace/serofoi")
```
## Quick start

```{r load_package, include = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(serofoi)
```

_{{ packagename }}_ provides some minimal serosurvey datasets that can be used to test out the package. For instance, the dataset `chagas2012` contains seroprevalence measures of IgG antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi infection corresponding to a serological survey conducted in Colombia during 2012 on a rural indigenous community that is known to present long-term endemic transmission 

```{r load_data, include = TRUE}
# Load example dataset chagas2012 included with the package
data(chagas2012)
head(chagas2012, 5)
```

A visualisation of the serological data can be obtained using the function `plot_serosurvey`:

```{r data_test, fig.cap = "Seroprevalence plot for the chagas2012 dataset.", include = TRUE, out.fig.height="30%", out.width="50%", fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_serosurvey(chagas2012, bin_serosurvey = TRUE, size_text = 15)
```
Here, the error bars correspond to the binomial confidence interval and the point size represents the sample size for each age group.

A constant FoI model can easily be implemented by means of `fit_seromodel`:

```{r constant_model, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
seromodel <- fit_seromodel(serosurvey = chagas2012)
```

For further details on how to visualise the results and other available models, please refer to the [online documentation](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/serofoi/).
